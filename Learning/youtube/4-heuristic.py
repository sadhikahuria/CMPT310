# Heuristic in AI
# solving not polynomial time problems
# Reduce time complexity and space complexity

# heuristic function
#   manhattan distance
#       sum of vertical and horizontal distances
#       |x2-x1| + |y2-y1|
#   euclidean distance
#       straight line distance
#       sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2)
#   hamming distance
#   admissible heuristic

# Admissible heuristic
#   h(n) <= h*(n)
#   underestimates the cost to reach the goal node
# Non-admissible heuristic
#   h(n) > h*(n)
#   overestimates the cost to reach the goal node
